These are the steps  that I took to get the gurobi python interface working on my machine:

- Created an account in gurobi website as an academic researcher

...
...
 Waited until my identity was verified by gurobi
...
...

- Downloaded gurobi from this [link](http://www.gurobi.com/downloads/gurobi-optimizer).
- Requested an academic license [here](https://user.gurobi.com/download/licenses/free-academic)
- Got the license key using `grbgetkey` tool (available in license center)
- added these lines to your `.bashrc` (or another startup file)
	export GUROBI_HOME="/path/to/gurobi/installation"
	export GRB_LICENSE_FILE="/path/to/gurobi.lic"
- ran this line in gurobi installation directory
	$ python setup.py install --user
